## Repository Description
This is the repository for the Vintage Story Herbalist Pots mod, which adds clay-formed herbalist pots that slowly grow more of the flower planted in it, providing a way to passively create more flowers in Vintage Story. There is currently no vanilla way to generate flowers (they do not spread after a flower patch has been generated in the initial
world gen for a chunk). This was made to be a game-appropriate way of making flowers renewable for mods that require many flowers to be used (such as Alchemy) as to not deplete
the world of these.

## Dependencies
This mod does not have any additional dependencies apart from the base game.

## How to use
This mod provides another recipe for pottery/clayforming to create a herbalist pot, which visually and functionally works the same as a vanilla large planting pot, but has the extended ability to slowly grow more of the planted flower. Once a flower is planted, it will slowly generate copies of it that can be harvested while holding shears. The herbalist pots can be made with any vanilla clay type and come in all the same color varieties that the vanilla planters have. The beehive kiln is supported with these pots to provide their extended range of colors, exactly matching the vanilla planters.

## Versioning Format
This mod is versioned in a way to be easily recognizable between regular versions of Vintage Story. The format is as follows:
`{beta|full}.{game version number}.{mod version}` (e.g. `0.21.1`)
1. `{beta|full}`: The first number denotes whether its a beta/untested version or whether its a full/stable version. This will always be either `0` for beta, or `1` for full.
2. `{game version number}`: This indicates what major version of Vintage Story this mod is for. Since this mod was initially made for VS version `1.21.6`, the first release version of this mod will be `21`, like in the example above.
3. `{mod version}`: This indicates the iteration of the mod for the specificed VS game version. This will be incremented after every subsequent release/fix of the mod for a specific version, starting with `0`.
